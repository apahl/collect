# collect

A few generic collection types for the Go programming language, including the missing sets.  
The collections make as much use of the new generics, as possible.

This is a module similar to several others, nothing special to see here.

Documentation:
* [Sets](https://godoc.org/github.com/apahl/collect/sets): SimpleSet, IntHashSet, StringHashSet
* [Maps](https://godoc.org/github.com/apahl/collect/maps): IntHashMap, StringHashMap
* [Slices](https://godoc.org/github.com/apahl/collect/slices): AreEqual()

Please refer to the tests for examples on how to use them.
